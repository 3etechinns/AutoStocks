# AutoStocks

### Goal:
A Node.js web app to manage a virtual stock portfolio and back-test trading algorithms.

This is an on-going project. My long-term goal is to use this to validate strategies and trade real money.

### Current features:

1) Secure logins and sign-ups using Passport.js

2) Support for stock price-checking using the IEX API.

3) Support for buying and selling stocks.

4) Data storage (both for users and for stock portfolios) using MySQL.

5) Live tracking of current stock prices; accompanying display on main page.

6) Working frontend with graphs for current and historical stock prices.

7) Python API wrapper for website and IEX API to trade autonomously.

### In-Progress:

1) Backtesting strategies

2) Improvements to make app more realistic; queue purchases made outside market hours, latency, etc.

3) Improvements to financial indicators shown in table.

### To-do:

1) Testing suite.

2) Security improvements (tbd)

3) Experimentation with algorithms

4) (medium-term) Host app remotely

5) (long-term) Incorporate financial authorization and trade real money
